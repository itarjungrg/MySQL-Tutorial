The MySQL SELECT Statement

--The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
--The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.

--SELECT Syntax
--SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country FROM Customers;
--SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT * FROM Customers;



The MySQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement

--The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
--Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.

--SELECT DISTINCT Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

--SELECT Example Without DISTINCT
SELECT Country FROM Customers;  


--The following SQL statement counts and returns the number of different (distinct) countries in the "Customers" table:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers;
